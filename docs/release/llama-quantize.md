# Improving Performance of LLAMA.CPP

## Improve performance of llm on llama-cpp for low-end GPU
To improve the performance of LLaMA models using `llama-cpp` on a low-end GPU, you can focus on the following strategies:

### 1. **Quantization**
   Quantizing the model to lower precision (e.g., int8 or int4) reduces the memory footprint and computation requirements, allowing for faster inference on low-end GPUs.
   - LLaMA models support quantization, and you can use tools like Hugging Face's `transformers` library or `llama.cpp` built-in support to perform quantization.
   - Quantization reduces the precision of the model's weights (e.g., from 16-bit floats to 8-bit integers), which can speed up inference with minimal accuracy loss.

   ```bash
   llama.cpp --quantize model.bin --output model-q4.bin --precision int4
   ```

### 2. **GPU-Specific Optimizations**
   Low-end GPUs may have fewer cores or less memory, so optimizations should account for that:
   - **Use the correct CUDA version**: Ensure that you're using a version of CUDA that's optimized for your specific GPU. Sometimes, using a newer CUDA version on an older GPU can cause performance issues.
   - **Reduce batch size**: Lower the batch size to fit within the available GPU memory and avoid unnecessary swapping of data between CPU and GPU.
   - **Profile memory usage**: Use tools like `nvidia-smi` to monitor GPU memory usage and optimize the model's memory footprint.
   
### 3. **Model Pruning**
   Pruning removes redundant or less important parameters from the model, reducing its size and computational complexity.
   - Apply structured or unstructured pruning techniques to the model using libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. This step can reduce model size while maintaining performance.

### 4. **Mixed-Precision Training/Inference**
   Mixed-precision training and inference leverage both float16 and float32 computations. This allows low-end GPUs that support half-precision to accelerate computations while keeping precision loss minimal.
   - If your GPU supports it, you can enable mixed precision using libraries like `torch.cuda.amp` (automatic mixed precision) in PyTorch.
   
   ```python
   with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
       output = model(input)
   ```

### 5. **Optimize Memory Usage**
   - **Offload parts of the model to CPU**: If GPU memory is tight, consider offloading part of the model or computation to the CPU while keeping the rest on the GPU.
   - **Enable memory-efficient attention**: Large models like LLaMA often suffer from memory bottlenecks due to self-attention mechanisms. Implement memory-efficient attention mechanisms, like FlashAttention, to improve throughput.

### 6. **TensorRT**
   If using an NVIDIA GPU, you can deploy the model with TensorRT to significantly boost performance. TensorRT optimizes the inference process by fusing layers and reducing computation overhead.
   - Convert the LLaMA model to ONNX format and optimize it with TensorRT.
   
   ```bash
   trtexec --onnx=model.onnx --fp16
   ```

### 7. **Asynchronous Execution**
   Implement asynchronous execution to overlap CPU and GPU operations, minimizing idle time and ensuring that the GPU is used as efficiently as possible. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow support asynchronous execution.

### 8. **Compile with Optimizations**
   When compiling `llama-cpp`, ensure that you enable optimizations for your GPU architecture (e.g., use `-O3` for maximum optimization).
   
   ```bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   make -j4
   ```

These strategies can help maximize the performance of LLaMA models on low-end GPUs using llama-cpp, allowing for more efficient resource usage and faster inference.

## On CPU-only with 6 core 12 thread and 32gb ram

For running LLaMA models on a 6-core, 12-thread CPU system with 32GB of RAM, you can still optimize performance by focusing on CPU efficiency and memory management. Here are some specific strategies:

### 1. **Quantization**
   As with GPU optimization, quantization is one of the most effective ways to reduce memory usage and improve inference speed. Use lower precision (e.g., int8 or int4) models, which significantly reduce memory and computation overhead.

   ```bash
   llama.cpp --quantize model.bin --output model-q4.bin --precision int4
   ```

### 2. **Multithreading Optimization**
   Since you have 6 cores and 12 threads, make sure that `llama-cpp` is set up to use all available CPU threads efficiently:
   - **Threading Libraries**: Ensure `llama-cpp` is compiled with support for OpenMP or another threading library that can distribute the workload across all available cores.
   - **Environment Variables**: You can control the number of threads used by OpenMP by setting the environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to match your CPU’s core count.

   ```bash
   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=12
   ```

   Additionally, you can tune this number based on your system's workload. For example, try adjusting between 8 to 12 threads and benchmark performance.

### 3. **Batching Input Requests**
   Grouping multiple inputs into batches can reduce redundant computation and improve throughput, especially for CPU inference. Instead of processing one query at a time, process a batch of them, which leverages the parallelism more effectively.

### 4. **Use Lightweight Models**
   If possible, consider using smaller LLaMA models, which require fewer resources. Models with fewer parameters will consume less memory and compute faster on a CPU without significantly compromising performance for many tasks.

### 5. **Efficient Memory Usage**
   Since your system has 32GB of RAM, make sure you're not running out of memory, as this will result in paging to disk, which significantly slows down performance. To manage memory efficiently:
   - **Memory-mapped files**: Use memory-mapped files to load only parts of the model into RAM, which can help reduce memory overhead.
   - **Streaming layers**: Stream model layers or only load active parts of the model into memory when needed.

### 6. **Profile CPU Performance**
   Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks in CPU utilization. Tools like `perf` on Linux or `top`/`htop` can help monitor CPU usage and determine if your threads are fully utilized. You may need to adjust the code or runtime configuration based on the profiling results to ensure no single core is bottlenecked.

### 7. **Use BLAS/LAPACK Libraries**
   Libraries like BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) or LAPACK are optimized for linear algebra operations and can help speed up matrix operations. Linking `llama-cpp` with highly optimized CPU math libraries such as OpenBLAS or Intel MKL can greatly improve performance.

   - **Install OpenBLAS** (or use Intel MKL if you have an Intel CPU):
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
     ```

   - **Link the model to the optimized BLAS library**.

### 8. **CPU-Specific Optimizations**
   When compiling `llama-cpp`, enable compiler optimizations specific to your CPU. You can enable optimizations like AVX, AVX2, or SSE, depending on your CPU’s capabilities. 

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-march=native -O3"
   make -j12
   ```

### 9. **Reduce Context Length**
   If your task allows, reduce the context length of the input data. Shorter sequences reduce the amount of computation required for self-attention and other model operations, speeding up inference.

### 10. **Asynchronous Inference**
   If you have a workload with multiple queries or tasks, consider implementing asynchronous inference. This allows you to overlap model execution with input/output operations, reducing idle CPU time.

By combining these techniques, you can optimize LLaMA models to run more efficiently on your 6-core CPU, even without GPU support.

## Using llama-quantize.exe
Based on the usage information provided for `llama-quantize.exe`, here's how you can quantize the LLaMA model to improve its performance on a CPU-only system with limited resources:

### Example Command:
To quantize your model to a smaller size (e.g., Q4_K_M), which should balance performance and accuracy on your system, you can run:

```bash
llama-quantize.exe model-f32.gguf model-quant.gguf Q4_K_M 12
```

Explanation:
- `model-f32.gguf`: The original float32 model file.
- `model-quant.gguf`: The output file for the quantized model.
- `Q4_K_M`: A quantization type that offers a good balance between size and accuracy (4.58GB with a low perplexity increase).
- `12`: Specifies the number of threads to use during the quantization process (your system has 12 threads).

### Parameters You Might Consider:
- **`--allow-requantize`**: If you're re-quantizing an already quantized model, you can use this option to allow it. However, it may decrease the quality of the model, so it's best to avoid it if possible.
- **`--leave-output-tensor`**: Use this option if you want to leave the output tensor unquantized, which can increase the model size but may preserve quality.
- **`--pure`**: This will disable mixed quantization types and use the same type for all tensors.
- **`--nthreads`**: Set the number of threads to match your system’s available threads (12 in your case) to speed up the quantization process.

### Quantization Types:
You can choose different quantization types depending on the trade-offs between model size and quality:
- **Q4_0** or **Q4_1**: These offer relatively small models but slightly higher perplexity (lower accuracy).
- **Q4_K_M**: A good balance of size and accuracy, often recommended for CPU inference.
- **Q5_K_M**: Higher accuracy but slightly larger model size.
- **Q2_K**: If memory is very constrained, this will result in smaller models, but the perplexity will be much higher, so it may not perform well for all tasks.

### General Guidance:
- **For smaller models with reasonable accuracy**, use **Q4_K_M** or **Q4_K_S**.
- **For memory-constrained environments**, use **Q2_K** or **Q3_K_M**, but expect a drop in accuracy.

Once quantized, you can load the quantized model into `llama-cpp` and benefit from reduced memory consumption and improved inference speed on your CPU-only system.

### Quantize for Intel(R) N100 800 MHz with 8GB ram using llama-quantize..exe 
To quantize a LLaMA model for an Intel N100 CPU (which operates at 800 MHz and has 8GB of RAM), you need to choose an approach that balances memory usage and performance, given the system's limitations. Here's how you can do that using `llama-quantize.exe`:

### Steps for Optimal Quantization:

#### 1. **Choose a Low-Memory Quantization Type:**
   Since you have 8GB of RAM, you’ll need to choose a quantization type that keeps memory usage low, while still maintaining reasonable performance. **Q2_K** or **Q3_K_M** would be good candidates because they reduce the model size significantly, though they may slightly compromise accuracy.

#### 2. **Use the Correct Number of Threads:**
   The Intel N100 has 4 cores, so you can use 4 threads for quantization. Adjust the `nthreads` parameter accordingly.

#### 3. **Example Command:**
   Assuming you're using the **Q2_K** quantization type (for minimal memory footprint) and using 4 threads, the command would look like this:

   ```bash
   llama-quantize.exe model-f32.gguf model-quant.gguf Q2_K 4
   ```

   Explanation:
   - `model-f32.gguf`: This is the input model in float32 format.
   - `model-quant.gguf`: This is the output file for the quantized model.
   - `Q2_K`: Quantization type that results in a smaller model (approximately 2.96GB).
   - `4`: Number of threads, corresponding to the number of CPU cores available on your Intel N100.

#### 4. **Consider Using `--leave-output-tensor` Flag:**
   If you want to keep the output layer in full precision (which can improve output quality), add the `--leave-output-tensor` flag:

   ```bash
   llama-quantize.exe model-f32.gguf model-quant.gguf Q2_K 4 --leave-output-tensor
   ```

### Quantization Type Selection:
Given your system constraints (low CPU clock speed and 8GB RAM), smaller quantization types are more appropriate:
- **Q2_K**: This would be the best option for reducing memory usage (down to around 3GB for a 7B model), though accuracy will suffer slightly.
- **Q3_K_M**: If you want a better trade-off between size and performance, use Q3_K_M, but it will use more RAM (around 3.74GB).

### General Tips:
- **Swap Memory (Page File)**: Ensure your system's swap memory (page file) is enabled and has enough space. This can help if the 8GB of RAM is insufficient, though it will slow down performance if memory paging to disk occurs.
- **Reduced Model Size**: Consider using a smaller version of the LLaMA model (e.g., 3B instead of 7B) if the quantized model is still too large to fit comfortably within 8GB of RAM.

By using the **Q2_K** or **Q3_K_M** quantization, the model should be small enough to run efficiently on your Intel N100 CPU with 8GB RAM.

## Quantizing LLaMA for Coral M.2 Accelerator
The Coral M.2 Accelerator is a specialized hardware accelerator designed for running AI models efficiently with 4 TOPS (tera operations per second) of compute power. Since the Coral Accelerator is based on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and uses TensorFlow Lite models with the Edge TPU Delegate, quantizing LLaMA models specifically for this hardware requires converting them into a format that the Coral can handle.

### Steps for Quantizing LLaMA for Coral M.2 Accelerator:

1. **Understand the Limitation**: 
   - Coral’s Edge TPU can run **int8 quantized models**. The key is to get the LLaMA model into a TensorFlow Lite-compatible int8 format, which can then be run on the Coral accelerator using the **Edge TPU delegate**.

2. **Convert LLaMA to TensorFlow Lite**: 
   Since `llama.cpp` doesn't directly support TensorFlow Lite or the Coral Accelerator, you'll need to:
   - Export LLaMA to ONNX or another format that can be imported into TensorFlow.
   - Convert the ONNX model to TensorFlow format.
   - Quantize the model to **int8** to be compatible with the Coral Edge TPU.

#### Detailed Steps:

### 1. **Convert LLaMA Model to ONNX:**
First, you’ll need to export the LLaMA model to ONNX format. This requires converting the original PyTorch or `llama.cpp`-based model to ONNX.

If you are using `llama.cpp` or a PyTorch model, you can use:

```bash
# For PyTorch
python -m transformers.onnx --model=LLaMA /path/to/model-f32
```

### 2. **Convert ONNX to TensorFlow:**
Once the model is in ONNX format, use the `onnx-tf` package to convert the ONNX model to TensorFlow.

```bash
pip install onnx-tf
onnx-tf convert -i model.onnx -o model.pb
```

### 3. **Quantize to int8 for Edge TPU:**
Now that the model is in TensorFlow format, use TensorFlow Lite's post-training quantization tool to quantize the model to int8, which is required for the Coral M.2 Accelerator.

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the TensorFlow model
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model('/path/to/model.pb')

# Apply int8 quantization
converter.optimizations = [tf.lite.Optimize.DEFAULT]
converter.target_spec.supported_ops = [tf.lite.OpsSet.TFLITE_BUILTINS_INT8]
converter.inference_input_type = tf.uint8  # Or tf.int8
converter.inference_output_type = tf.uint8  # Or tf.int8

# Convert the model
tflite_quant_model = converter.convert()

# Save the quantized model
with open('model-int8.tflite', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(tflite_quant_model)
```

### 4. **Compile for Coral Edge TPU:**
Once you have the `int8` quantized `.tflite` model, compile it using the **Edge TPU Compiler** to optimize it for the Coral Accelerator.

Download and install the Edge TPU Compiler from [here](https://coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/compiler/).

```bash
edgetpu_compiler model-int8.tflite
```

This will generate a new model that is optimized for the Coral TPU, typically named `model-int8_edgetpu.tflite`.

### 5. **Run the Model on Coral:**
Finally, you can run the compiled model on your Coral M.2 Accelerator using the Edge TPU Delegate in TensorFlow Lite.

Here’s an example of how to load and run inference on the Coral TPU:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from pycoral.utils.edgetpu import make_interpreter
from pycoral.adapters.common import input_tensor, output_tensor

# Load the Coral-compiled model
interpreter = make_interpreter('model-int8_edgetpu.tflite')
interpreter.allocate_tensors()

# Prepare input (adjust based on your model)
input_data = np.array([...], dtype=np.uint8)  # Example input
input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data)

# Run inference
interpreter.invoke()

# Get output
output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()
output_data = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
print(output_data)
```

### Summary of Key Steps:
1. Convert LLaMA model to ONNX.
2. Convert ONNX to TensorFlow format.
3. Quantize the TensorFlow model to **int8** using TensorFlow Lite.
4. Compile the quantized `.tflite` model using the Coral **Edge TPU Compiler**.
5. Run the model on the Coral Accelerator using the **Edge TPU Delegate** in TensorFlow Lite.

This process ensures that the LLaMA model is optimized for the Coral M.2 Accelerator's 4 TOPS performance, allowing efficient inference on Edge TPUs with minimal memory usage.
